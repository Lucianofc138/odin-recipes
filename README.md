# Odin project recipes

## Introduction

The focus of this project is to practice basic HTML by creating a page with some of my favorite recipes.
It will grow as I continue the Odin project roadmap, so in the future it could include some CSS and Javascript
for a better experience.

## How to run

Right now the easiest way to run the project is with NPM http-server in the root directory folder of the project.

```bash
    http-server .
```

However if you don't have the package installed (globally) you can install it like:

```bash
    npm i http-server -g
```
