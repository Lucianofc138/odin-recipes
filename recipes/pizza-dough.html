    <p>This is one is the best fucking pizza dough you will ever try.</p>
    <p>For real.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300 gr. wholemeal flour - 60%</li>
        <li>200 gr. white flour - 40%</li>
        <li>8 gr. instant yeast - 1.6% </li>
        <li>>300 ml. warm water - >60% </li>
        <li>1 spoon white sugar </li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>ollive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Pour the wholemeal flour and the white flour in a bowl, and then mix them until it's a homogeneous mix. 
            This is going to be used as the 100% to calculate the needed amount of other ingredients.
        </li>

            The secret for the perfect pizza dough is the high level of hydration. 
            Which should be at least 60% but it can be much more depending on how much does your flour absorb, up to 80%.
            Take the 60% of warm water (this should not burn or be near to burn your hand if you place it inside) and add 
            the spoon of white sugar, and the 8 gr. of instant yeast.
            Wait around 10 minutes or until you see some foeam on the top. If this doesn't happen your yeast is probably 
            dead. Maybe because your water was too hot or maybe it was dead before.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dig a hole in the center of the flour mix and add the warm water with the yeast. Then spread the salt on the 
            borders avoid placing it directly over the yeasty water, since that could dehydrate the yest. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Start mixing with a wooden spoon from the inside of the bowl, slowly incorporating the flour mix to the yeasty
            water, until you have a homogeneous dough. Let it rest for around an hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            After that hour, separate the dough from the bowl and cover all its (dough) surface with olive oil. You can also
            make the dough roll on the bowl so you can give it a rounder shape.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let the dough rest again, but this time inside your refrigerator. It should be at least a few hours but it works
            the best over 12 hours. Also consider that with that amount of time the surface can get a little dry, so it can 
            it would be a good idea to place a wet cloth over the dough, and be sure it doesn't get dry every few hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now your pizza dough is almost ready! To cook it, cover you oven tray with oil and add some semolina equally 
            distributed all over the tray. Place the needed amount of dough on the center of the tray and extend it over the 
            tray without using a wearer since that would make the dough loose a big part of the air inside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally put tomato sauce, vegan cheese and any topping you like on your pizza, except for pineapple (I'm watching you),
            and put it inside a preheated oven at the highest possible temperature.
